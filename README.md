## Getting Started ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

### Install dependencies

Check if you are running the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Install [Expo](https://expo.io/) globally on your computer and create your [Expo account](https://expo.io/signup).

```sh
$ npm install expo-cli --global
```

Start by downloading/cloning this repository.

Then in the project root directory install the application's dependencies.

```
npm install
```

#### Running the App ‚ú®

To start the project, run the following in your terminal:

```sh
$ npm run start
```

or

```sh
$ expo start
```

This will now automatically open a tab in your browser called the Metro Bundler.

##### Mobile Device Setup üì±

You can then run the app on your own mobile device by installing the Expo app through your device's app store.

- You will need to login into Expo on your device in order to access the app
- Use your camera on your device to read the QR Code on the Metro Builder and the app will start

##### Device Emulator Setup üíª

If you would like to run the app on your computer through a simulator/emulator, you will either need:

- [Android Studio](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/)

Both can be accessed through the Metro Bundler after the emulators have been installed.
